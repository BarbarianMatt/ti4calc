Credit goes out to the original author of the website, alphamouse, who I edited the original calculator from which can be found at http://alphamou.se/ti4calc/. I didn't really want to do a fork as I have never used github before and my code is a little garbage if you know what I mean.

I added leaders, a whole bunch of action cards, added some agendas and the nebulae which I thought was weirdly missing from the original. The new factions should work correctly. Sardakk mechs and reflective shield, with some other abilities, could only be simulated even thought they could have been calcualted, I am just not smart enough to figure it out.

Alot of other cool features can be found from trying things out. One note, I made it so that L1Z1X units with bombardment don't have to bombard initially in hopes of recreating ground combats in systems in with multiple planets where the units with bombardment can't necesssariy bombard each planet equally
