This is a Battle Calculator for the game Twilight Imperium 4th Edition. Its purpose is to solve the probability of the attacker or defender winning in space combat given units, technology, leaders, action cards, promissory notes, and other abilities. This solves, not simulates, the probability of a side winning, which has the advantage of being much faster and 100% accurate. However, solving is not always possible so simulation is used for L1Z1X flagship, Letnev flagship, Duranium Armor technology, Non-Euclidean Shielding technology, and specific interactions with the Sardakk mech. Significant changes to the original algorithm were needed to have more discrete timing s of sustain damage, gaining hits due to using sustain damage, timings for multiple start of combat abilities, non-combat hits that can only hit specific types of units, etc.
